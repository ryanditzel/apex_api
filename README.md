## Summary
For my second project I plan to build a full stack app. I will build a database of the characters you can play as in the video game Apex Legends. The database will be searchable, and will have a featuring allowing to add, remove, update abilities from the database.

## Back End
For the database, I will build out a collection that includes characters details and their specific abilities, linking via the "one-to-one" data structure.

### Controllers
I will also need to create Controller methods to access all of the entries from each collection, as well as to create, update and delete entries from the database. 

## Front End
Will consist of a landing page, a header bar with a few navigation buttons ("Home", "Legends", "Add Legend", "About"), and a search bar to find characters based off of their name. Using React Router I will create components to display a more in depth breakdown of the character.

The **Search** Component will be included on the landing page, and will allow the user to search the character collection by the name of the legend they're looking for, and display all entries that match their search query.

## Technologies Used
VS Code, Figma, Trello, Github

## Work Plan and Resources

I will first focus on building out the API and the backend portion of this fullstack app. Once complete I will move on to frontend followed by styling.
